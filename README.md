# Icon-Hover-Effect

## Project Description

This project has the ability to transition from one color to another with a box shadow that appears when the user hovers the pointer over the icon and will fade out once the pointer is moved away from the icon.  The icons will direct the user to my social web pages in accordance to the icon that is clicked on.  This is a practical use case for any application that may have a clickable icon that directs the user to another site or even a page within the application.
